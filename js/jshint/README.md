# About

VIA Studio uses `jshint` for greater flexibility with our JavaScript coding standards. We currently use the [default configuration](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/blob/master/examples/.jshintrc) for `jshint`.

# Requirements

- [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/)

# Installation

You do not need to perform any additional installation steps after installing `jshint`.

If you wish to customize your configuration or exclude files, you can add the `-c` or `--excluded-path` arguments for `jshint` respectively.
